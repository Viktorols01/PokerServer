To implement your own bot, the only thing that needs to be done is implementing the function "getMove(HoldEmModel model)".
This function takes the state of the game (in the form of an object of class HoldEmModel) and returns a move (in the form of a protocol command).

The HoldEmModel class has the following structure:
    HoldEmModel
    - getPlayers()
        ArrayList<PlayerData>
        - get(int i)
            PlayerData*
    - getWhoToPlay()
        PlayerData*
    - getYou()
        PlayerData*
    - getCommunityCards()
        CardCollection**
    - getPot()
        int
    - getRemainingBet()   
        int
    - getSmallBlind()
        int

    *PlayerData
    - getName()
        String
    - getHand()
        CardCollection**
    - getMarkers()
        int
    - getBettedMarkers()
        int
    - getBlind()
        String
    - hasFolded()
        boolean

    **CardCollection
    - get(int i)
        Card***
    - size()
        int

    ***Card
    - getValue()
        int
    - getColor()
        Color
    - toString()
        String

Also, make sure to note that cards that are supposed to be unknown to you will simply be null.

To make things simple, I have created shorthands for making certain moves. These are the available options:
    return match()
    return check()
    return raise(int n)
    return fold()
Simply use these commands to perform the corresponding move.
